"""Execute a ROS node using the drums_driver module.

This node reads messages from a custom topic (external), parses them into
the value that Gazebo expects, and then publishes these messages to
Gazebo (internal). For the drums driver, these messages are Float64 values
that represent the velocity that should be applied to raising or lowering the arms.

The abstraction done by this node is necessary to be able to switch
between hardware and software; a similarly written hardware node could
listen to the same instructions topic and command actuators, instead of the sim.
